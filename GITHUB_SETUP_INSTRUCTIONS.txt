GitHub Repository Setup Instructions
======================================

After creating your public GitHub repository, run these commands:

# Add the GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sticky-notes-django.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push all branches to GitHub
git push -u origin main
git push origin docs
git push origin container

# Verify all branches are pushed
git branch -a

Your repository URL will be:
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sticky-notes-django

IMPORTANT: Update the capstone.txt file with your actual repository URL!
